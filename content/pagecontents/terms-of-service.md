If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to “you” or “Customer” reference your company.

These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy, if applicable pursuant to Section 6.3 below, and any on-line or written order form for the purchase of the Services (as herein defined) (each, a “**Service Order**“), collectively constitute a binding agreement between Cartrabbit and you or the legal entity you represent (“**Customer**” or “**you**“). These Terms of Service also apply if you purchase a right to use the Services (as defined below) pursuant to a Service Order entered into between you and a Retainful-authorized agent, vendor, or reseller of the Services (an “**Authorized Reseller**“).

Customer desires to use Retainful’s online customer management services presently offered or available, (the “**Services**“) using Retainful’s Customer’s instructions and other documentation of Retainful (the “**Retainful Documentation**“). Customer management services include using Retainful software to retrieve customer information from customer emails, websites and similar opt-ins, and transactions (the “**Communications**“), viewing data available from the Communications, and using Retainful’s marketing platform to send messages to end customers through email and SMS text messages. Retainful will permit Customer to use the Services and the Retainful Documentation subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service. By using the Services, Customer agrees to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, including but not limited to the limitations on liability set forth herein. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, CUSTOMER IS NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.

1.  ### SERVICES
    
    1.  #### Agreement to Provide Services.

Customer’s Services start on the date of the beginning of the Term as defined in Section 12. Customer understands and agrees that by using the on-line registration process and agreeing to the terms of these Terms of Service, Customer has made a binding selection of the type of Services to be provided and all associated specifications, prices, policies and documentation related to the delivery of the Services.
        
    2.  #### Service Orders.
        
        Each Service Order is hereby incorporated into these Terms of Service by this reference and is subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service; provided, however, that in the event of conflict with the terms contained in any Service Order, the terms contained in these Terms of Service shall control. In the event of any conflict between the terms of these Terms of Service or a Service Order and any Customer-issued order form or purchase order, the terms of these Terms of Service and the applicable Service Order shall control.
        
2.  ### MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE

Retainful may modify these Terms of Service or any policy or other terms referenced in these Terms of Service including but not limited to the Privacy Policy and, if applicable, the EU Data Protection Addendum (collectively, “**Additional Policies**“) at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms of Service and the Additional Policies on the Retainful Site. Unless otherwise set forth in these Terms of Service, the revised terms shall be effective (a) fifteen (15) days after posting and/or notifying Customers of the changes (including through a notice submitted by Retainful to an Authorized Reseller to be then passed along to a Customer); or (b) upon Customer’s acceptance if Retainful or an Authorized Reseller provides a mechanism for Customer’s immediate acceptance of the revised terms, such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button, whichever occurs first.

Each Service Order shall continue for the Term specified therein, and will AUTOMATICALLY RENEW for subsequent Terms (“**Renewal Term**“) unless either party provides at least 5 business days written notice of non-renewal prior to the expiration of the then-current Term that it elects not to renew the Services under such Service Order at the end of such Term.
    2.  #### Termination by Customer.   
        Notification of of such non-renewal from Customer to Retainful must be emailed to support@retainful.com, which must be confirmed by Retainful. If Customer chooses not to renew, Customer must fully notify Retainful in writing at least \[48 business hours\] prior to the Renewal Term, in which case, Customer will continue to have access to the Services and be billed until the end of the then current term. Customer shall not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Term. In the case Customer fails to fully notify Retainful of its intent not to renew within this time, the Renewal Term will commence at the end of the then-current term and Customer is responsible for the payment of Fees for the Services rendered for that Renewal Term. Customer shall not in any event be entitled to any refund of any Fees previously paid to Retainful for Services.    
    3.  #### Termination by Retainful.  
        Retainful shall have the right to terminate these Terms of Service at any time without cause and without notice. In addition, Retainful may terminate these Terms of Service upon written notice to Customer (or upon written notice provided to an Authorized Reseller and then passed along by an Authorized Reseller to a Customer) if Customer becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, or liquidation for the benefit of creditors. Upon a termination by Retainful without cause, Customer may be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid and unused Fees advanced to Retainful. 
    4.  #### Past Due Bills.    
        In the event of a credit card decline, Retainful, or if applicable, an Authorized Reseller, will attempt to reach out to Customer for a new payment method. If Retainful or, if applicable, an Authorized Reseller, fail to resolve the issue with Customer, the account will be terminated due to non-payment and Retainful will attempt to collect on any past due balances at Customer’s expense. Per Section 4.2, in the event Customer, or if applicable, an Authorized Reseller, requests to cancel with a past due balance, Customer is required to pay for the month of service from their initial bill date decline.   
    5.  #### Consequences of Termination.   
        Upon termination of these Terms of Service or the Service for any reason, Customer shall cease to use the Retainful Platform, the Services and Documentation. Retainful retains the right to terminate Customer’s access to any Retainful Platform and Services in the event of termination by either party.    
    6.  #### Data Preservation, Retrieval or Transfer.  
        In the event of a temporary suspension of Customer’s access to Services,    
        1.  Retainful will not take any action to intentionally erase or delete Customer Data stored on the Services; and
        2.  applicable Fees will continue to accrue. In the event of the termination of these Terms of Service, Customer may, upon reasonable notice to Retainful, elect to retrieve Customer Data directly. If these Terms of Service are terminated for any reason other than Customer’s breach, Retainful will not take any action to intentionally erase or delete Customer Data stored on the Services for a period of sixty (60) days. If these Terms of Service are terminated on account of Customer’s breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Service, Retainful will not take any action to intentionally erase or delete Customer Marketing Content or Customer Data stored on the Services for a period of \[fifteen (15) days, or for sixty (60) days with respect to customer Communications as discussed above\]. In each case, Customer’s post-termination retrieval or transfer of Customer Data will be conditioned on Retainful’s receipt of all applicable Fees for the period following termination, payment in full of any other amounts owed, and Customer’s compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as Retainful may establish with respect to such retrieval or transfer. In addition, if Customer utilizes the professional services of Retainful to assist Customer in connection with such retrieval or transfer, Customer will be responsible for Retainful’s then current charges for such professional services. In the event that Retainful does not receive all such Fees and amounts due within the applicable time periods described above, or in the event that Customer fails to notify Retainful of Customer’s election with respect to the retrieval or transfer of Customer Data within such period, Retainful shall have no obligation to continue to store Customer Data or permit Customer to retrieve or transfer the same.

    2.  #### Entire Agreement.
        These Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, applicable Service Orders, and if applicable, the EU Data Protection Addendum, set forth the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior understandings and communications relating thereto. No term or condition of any other document provided to Retainful which is different from, inconsistent with, or in addition to the terms and conditions set forth herein will be binding upon Retainful.   
    3.  #### Modification; Waiver.  
        Retainful shall have the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of these Terms of Service at [https://www.retainful.com/terms-of-service](https://www.retainful.com/terms-of-service).

Continued use of the Services after any such changes are posted shall constitute Customer’s agreement to such changes. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of such party to avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege.   
    4.  #### Governing Law. 
        These Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Singapore without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration agreement discussed in section 14.12. Unless you and Retainful agree otherwise in writing, in the event that the arbitration agreement is found not to apply to you or a particular claim (except for small claims court actions), as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that the claim will be resolved exclusively by the federal court in Singapore. You and Retainful agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Singapore for the purposes of litigating such claims. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Your use of the Services may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.   
    5.  #### Assignment.    
        Customer may not assign its rights or delegate any obligations hereunder without the express prior written consent of Retainful. Any assignment by Customer without the prior written consent of Retainful shall be null and void. Retainful may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without notice or consent; provided, however, that the Services shall continue to operate as specified in these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service shall inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.   
    6.  #### Force Majeure  
        If either party is unable to perform any of its obligations hereunder (other than payment obligations) due to any act of God, fire, casualty, flood, war, strike, shortage or any other cause beyond its reasonable control, and if such party uses reasonable efforts to avoid such occurrence and minimize its duration and gives prompt notice to the other party, then the affected party’s performance shall be excused and the time for its performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform. If the force majeure continues for more than thirty (30) calendar days, then either party may terminate these Terms of Service for convenience upon written notice to the other party. 
    7.  #### Severability.  
        In the event that any provision contained herein shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, to such extent such provision shall be deemed null and void and severed from these Terms of Service, and the remainder hereof shall remain in full force and effect and enforceable.   
    8.  #### Independent Contractor.    
        Neither Customer nor Retainful shall be deemed to be an agent of the other and the relationship of Customer and Retainful shall be that of independent contractors. Neither Customer nor Retainful shall have any right or authority to assume any obligations, or to make any representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on behalf of the other party, or to bind the other party in any matter whatsoever..   
    9.  #### Notices.   
        Except as otherwise provided, notices under these Terms of Service shall be delivered by email addressed to the other party at such address as is set forth in the applicable Service Order or such other email address as Customer may provide to Retainful. Such notice will be deemed to have been given as of the date it is delivered by electronic mail, personally, by confirmed facsimile or by courier, or five (5) days after it is sent by postal mail. All communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to these Terms of Service shall be in the English language.  
    10.  #### Compliance with Laws. 
        Customer agrees to comply at all times with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to Customer’s use of the Services, including but not limited to data privacy laws and legal requirements.    
    11.  #### Headings. 
        The headings of the sections of these Terms of Service are for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered in construing these Terms of Service.  
    12.  #### Arbitration.  
        In any claim, action or proceeding to enforce any right or obligation of the parties under these Terms of Service including, without limitation, relating to your use of our services, you hereby waive any right you may now have or hereafter possess to a trial by jury. Both parties agree to resolve any dispute either Party may have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Retainful Services in good faith mediation. In the event no mutual agreement is made under mediation within sixty (60) days of notice of such dispute, the Parties have the right to resolve such dispute via arbitration in Singapore administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.. Even if allowed under SIAC Rules, no class or collective action or arbitration may be brought against Retainful hereunder unless required by applicable law. If either you or Retainful intends to seek arbitration under these terms of service, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Retainful should be sent as required by these Terms of Service. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If you and Retainful are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration. The arbitration, information produced, and pre-and post-hearing proceedings will be confidential and any award shall not be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. 
    13.  #### Class Action Waiver.  
        Any claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“**Class Action**”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the arbitration agreement in Section 14.12, if otherwise effective, shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
