## What is an exit intent popup?

You definitely must have experienced this. When you go into a brick-and-mortar store, a sales agent follows you closely looking at what you are about to purchase. If they find you unsatisfied and leaving, they immediately come up with sweet words accompanied by a probable offer so that the sale is alive.

When this scenario gets digitized, it turns out to be popup exit-intent Shopify or WooCommerce technology.

With exit-intent popup, the technology tracks the movement of the mouse and site visitor. If by any chance, the mouse moves towards the top as to close the tab and abandon the page, a popup appears with some interesting content to engage the visitor and get them subscribed or complete the purchase.


## How does exit intent popup benefit the eCommerce sector?

The benefits of using an exit-intent popup for eCommerce stores are primarily two.

**Timing**

Exit-intent popup is the one and only method to change the mind of the customer just seconds before leaving a page. A visitor stays on a page after adding items to the cart if he is in a dilemma. Those moments are the ones that the exit-intent technology uses to tap into the mind of the site visitor. Each and every second count and with exit-intent, it is put to good use.

**Conversion rate**

The conversion rate for a regular popup ranges anywhere between 3% and 10% but it goes as high as 53% for exit-intent popups. Considering the fact that these are last-minute conversions before exiting, the numbers are extraordinary. It so happens that even <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/how-to-write-abandoned-cart-emails-in-woocommerce" rel="noopener" target="_blank">email marketing for cart recovery</link-text>, that might take days or weeks, is nowhere closer to this number.

### Cross-sell/Upsell

A sale never ends even when you are about to leave the store. The sight of chocolates at the billing counter and pamphlets for the next purchase are proof of it.

### Customer Service & Feedback

Site visitors do seek help even during the last step of purchase if any sort of confusion or issue arises. They might have doubts regarding the return policy, payment methods, or any other. When the visitor does not know where to look for help, he will abandon the page. This is an apt time to use an exit-intent popup with a live chat option to get things resolved.

## Exit intent popup for Abandoned Cart Recovery

This is going to be the point of focus for the rest of this blog.

A final request can be displayed to not abandon the cart and own the items wished for with the help of exit-intent popup. But will a simple request alone do wonders? Never.

Check out what must be done in the first place.


### Types of exit intent to address cart abandonment

To get site visitors converted into customers, some techniques need to be deployed that triggers the person psychologically.

Play with minds and reap success.

#### Give a discount

A discount is what every shopper is on the lookout for. The chances of backing out from shopping when he sights one is rare. So, discount is the bait here.

You need to provide a discount with the exit-intent popup that does not burn a hole in your pocket but at the same time satisfies the customer. It is also a better idea to apply the discount directly to the cart so that the customer need not type in the code.


Pro Tip: Make the discount personalized with an automatically generated coupon code.

#### Get the email

An email is essential when dealing with guest users of a Shopify or WooCommerce eCommerce site. The information is crucial for email marketing purposes, especially if the person has created an abandoned cart.

![](../images/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce/3-save-to-email-exit-intent-popup.png)

The example given here is not a regular cart recovery exit-intent popup that asks for an email. The usual ones only get the email for future use but this popup does two things - saves the shopping cart to the email and the site visitor furnishes the contact information.

_**Takeaway:** Give the customer a reason to get the email details._


#### Create urgency with countdown timer

Instilling a sense of urgency by using a countdown timer is one effective way to get the visitor purchase the products in the abandoned cart.

The example below shows an offer coupled with the countdown timer which makes sense otherwise the purpose of the timer is lost.


![](../images/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce/4-countdown-timer-exit-intent-popup.png)


You would never want to make the deal when taking instant action within the stipulated time frame shells out the same money as the normal purchase.

_**Takeaway:** A discount or some other special offer is a must when using a countdown timer._

#### Bring in product scarcity

You might think ‘Should I really wipe out the products from my inventory to use this tactic?’ The truth is that you need not. After all, it is a strategy.
  
Customers are never going to know if your claims are right or wrong. When you say ‘Only 2 items left’, they take it for real. Emphasize on this scarcity in the exit-intent popup when visitors abandon a cart to win them back.

_**Pro Tip:** Do not use this method often. If done so, this might turn against you for faking scarcity._

### A CTA tip to nurture

</br>

A photographer, <link-text url="https://optinmonster.com/how-scott-wyden-imagery-reduced-woocommerce-cart-abandonment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Wyden, recovered 21% of abandoned carts</link-text> and grew his email list to 3x with WooCommerce exit-intent popup.


What did he do?

![](../images/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce/10-scott-wyden-exit-intent-popup.png)


He included 2 CTAs in the exit-intent popup like in the above image. You give the option of a ‘no’ to the site visitor. This makes the popup look more credible.

  

More examples of 2 CTA buttons.

  

![](../images/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce/11-CTA-button-example1.png)

<br>

<br>


![](../images/how-to-setup-exit-intent-popups-for-abandoned-cart-recovery-in-woocommerce/13-CTA-button-example3.png)

<br>


The text of the CTA buttons also matters a lot. When the ‘yes’ button tends to send out the message about the customer being benefitted, the ‘no’ button portrays losing the exclusive offer or benefit.
