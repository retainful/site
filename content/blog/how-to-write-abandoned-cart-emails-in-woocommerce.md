### 3. Single-click cart recovery (Call to Action)

If you are taking them through a complex checkout process with multiple steps, there are chances that the customer might get distracted and will not complete his purchase. So ensure a distraction-free, single click recovery. And make sure you include that recovery link in the email follow-up.
