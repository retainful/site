Have you ever come across a Shopify store with no record of abandoned carts? Silly question, is it? It is well known that there is no eCommerce store with zero cart abandonment rate. At least, it does give a head start to the topic right. 🙂

The reality of shopping cart abandonment is that the future of it cannot be predicted. As of now, there are plenty of <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/why-customers-abandon-shopping-cart-and-proven-ideas-to-recover-abandoned-carts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reasons for cart abandonment</link-text> and with each reason as the focus, a number of cart recovery apps can be designed and developed.

Companies put their best foot forward to resolve customer issues but when one is resolved, a thousand others crop up. After all, we are dealing with stuff that has an amalgamation of human behavior and machine thinking. So, issues are bound to recur.

This implies that there is not going to be an end to shopping cart abandonment but it can be brought under control and lowered to the minimal level possible with some of the best Shopify apps for cart recovery.

Check them out.

CartKit, previously named Consistent Cart, is one of the best cart abandonment Shopify apps. The app claims to be a 10-in-1 tool to support multi-channel marketing rather than getting sidelined with just one marketing tactic.

## Abandoned Cart Reminder by SpurIT 

<br>

![Abandoned Cart Reminder by SpurIT](../images/the-10-best-shopify-apps-to-recover-abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-reminder-spurIT.jpg)

 
This app by SpurIT was a random choice at first to be included in the list. After giving it a read, I felt that it deserves to be here for its uniqueness. Kudos to the brains behind it.

Do you think emails, popups, and discounts, are the only way to recover carts? If so, I am afraid you are wrong.

Heard of a blinking tab?

I see you getting curious. Check out the features.

<h3>Features</h3>

-   The Blinking Tab
   
A person who usually abandons a cart is mostly in a situation of dilemma and hence just skips that tab and moves on to another one rather than closing it. Abandoned Cart Reminder uses this instance as an opportunity to recover sales.

When a person moves on to browse in another tab, the tab where the visitor abandoned the cart starts blinking with a message on it. It gets noticed and the visitor returns.

-   The Bar

On return, the visitor finds a bar which displays a second message to complete the purchase. The messages displayed here usually creates a sense of urgency to act fast.

![The Bar](../images/the-10-best-shopify-apps-to-recover-abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-reminder-bar-message.jpg)


<h3>Highlights</h3>

-   One-click installation.
    
-   Cart recovery has never been faster. It happens in seconds.
    
-   Fully customizable messages.
    
-   Discount code can be included in the bar.
    
-   Follow-up recovery emails can be sent if the visitor closes the tab rather than switching.
    
<h3></h3>

Here is a statement from one of their customers which shows that the functionality of the app exceeds expectations.

“Sorry but I wanted to rate this App 10 but only found 5 stars! …Helpful team and easy to use app. Well done!” - Volanie Creative Designs

<h3>Pricing</h3>

$8.95 per month.

5-day free trial available.

<cta url="https://apps.shopify.com/abandoned-cart-reminder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Abandoned Cart Reminder by SpurIT</cta>

## A brief analysis…

I am not sure if you noticed. Of all the 10 apps that have been detailed in this post, Retainful is the only one that has the yearly payment option at such a low price.

When you have to pay $29 minimum + extra charges almost every month for most of the Shopify apps, Retainful sticks to $69 /year with all of the prime features available in the free plan itself.

If you are a startup looking to make it big in the world of eCommerce, then look no further. Retainful is just a click away.

If quality and service are what you are concerned about, opt for the below apps.

For abandoned cart emails - Retainful

For FB Messenger marketing - Recart

For Push notifications - PushOwl

Analyze for yourself, make the right choice, and witness your business grow.
