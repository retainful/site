Dear Reader!

You’d have definitely heard about Customer retention and Cart abandonment in the journey of growing your eCommerce business. Well, if you are some early bird into eCommerce, knowing the following stats is must to get your online store growing,

**One…** *Online Cart Abandonment*- 7/10 online customers abandon shopping carts.

Which means 70% of people shopping at your store add products to their cart but exit without checking out.

That’s 70% of potential sale volume waiting in abandoned carts.

**Two…** *Customer Retention*- Retaining an existing customer saves you 5 times the cost of acquiring a new customer.

Say, you gotta be spending $5 to make a new customer buy something at your online store but spend $1 to make an existing customer buy again at your store.
