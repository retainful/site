### Dashboard & Cart Recovery Ideas
- You can track three type carts in your WooCommerce store.
- Abandoned Carts, Recovered carts & In-progress carts.  
    While the first two are self-explanatory, the third type- In progress cart is an exclusive Retainful feature.    
- The in-progress cart or live cart shows the list of online carts that are being actively shopped at that particular moment.   

Also… you can retrieve a lot of useful data with which you can plan your cart recovery email strategy.
- Cart Status says whether the cart is abandoned, recovered or live. Interestingly, the color given to each cart status makes it much simpler to identify the cart types.
- Cart Expired date- The success of every cart recovery email campaign depends on how often you send the cart recovery email reminders. Getting to know when the cart abandonment date helps to <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/grow-your-ecommerce-store-with-9-effective-automated-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schedule and automate your recovery email campaigns</link-text>.   
- Customer name/ IP- Track customers who abandon carts and offer them with special <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/blog/wordpress/how-to-create-a-user-role-specific-coupon-code" rel="noopener" target="_blank">customer based coupons.</link-text>
- Customer type and email show whether the customer is registered or a guest user.
- Cart Value- Until you see how much sale volume is abandoned, you won’t really push harder. Measure the success of your cart recovery email campaign by comparing the values of the abandoned and recovered cart value.

### Recover abandoned carts

Now you have seen the abandoned carts in your WooCommerce store. The next step is to recover them.
Retainful comes with an easy, automatic cart recovery feature as well. You can create a sequence of abandoned cart recovery emails, which are sent in well-timed intervals.

For Example:

- Send an email 1 hour after customer abandons the cart
- Do another email follow-up 3 hours after the cart is abandoned
- Remind the customer again 1 day after the abandonment
- Still not recovered, send one more reminder 2nd day.

These emails can be automatically sent using the Retainful. You can create this email sequence using Retainful in minutes.
