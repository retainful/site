The above factors play a key role in the cart recovery process.

1.  Paying attention to your website design and easy usability increases sales. This includes an attractive design, well-placed contents, call to action links and so on.
    
2.  Concentrate on how do you design the template and contents of your cart recovery emails.

**Customize your content**

Do not let emails be "just reminders" instead turn them into engaging, lively content.

Content is the core reason why you are valued. So just do not rely totally upon the existing template styles. Try creating your own brand value and add value to your reminder emails.

**Avoid Hidden costs**

_"Hidden costs are rude shocks"_

They are going to discourage customers from checking out resulting in abandoned carts. And it is one of those top-grossing factors causing cart abandonment. So, try calculating all of those additional costs like taxes, shipping, and pending dues upfront and displaying them.

### Site speed

_"Hurry up, your customers are impatient"_

Irrespective of all your efforts, if there is a delay in the site loading time, then it is directly going to reflect on abandoned carts.

A review suggests that with an increase in the loading time of a website over three seconds, the bounce rate exponentially increases. So keeping a considerably fast loading time is going to give a heads up for the recovery process.

### Sync user account

_"Customers lost while transiting?"_

Changing from one device to another might end up losing cart data. So make sure that you take the necessary steps to ensure whether the customer’s email Id and other details are synced with their carts.

So that even if there is a change in the device, carts details will be saved and resumed. By this the chances of the customer checking out the cart after changing the device increases.

### Hassle-free checkouts

The checkout process itself should be easy without complicated steps or with too many fields to enter. Further, guest checkout facility, support for multiple payment gateways and overall security ensuring the process can act as added advantageous points in the process of cart recovery.

### Customer loyalty

**How to earn customer loyalty?**

-   Quality product/service
    
-   Timely delivery
    
-   Optimal pricing
    
-   Satisfying discounts/offers
    
-   Good customer and feedback support system
    

**How to earn out of customer loyalty?**

-   Brand collaboration
    
-   Social and referral Rewards
    
-   Discounts for loyalty
    
-   Loyalty program with a philanthropic aspect
    
### Communicate

_"Hi there, may I help you"_

Customers tend to have queries, suggestions, and feedback that needs to be addressed. Having an FAQ section, live chat or a customer support system can be of great help. By this, we get much more opportunity to understand and address customer’s needs and issues by doing this.

### Personalization

_"Everyone likes to be special"_

Personalization gives a rememberable shopping experience. This has many benefits both from the customer and the retailer's end. With a focus on the benefits from the seller’s end, firstly customer satisfaction will be developed. This will reciprocate in the form of repeated purchases, word of mouth promotions, customer loyalty and much more.
