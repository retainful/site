A cart that is abandoned is lost forever if timely action is not initiated. The startling truth is that the customer is lost too. Using a strategic plan to get back customers to complete the purchase is crucial to retain them for a longer time and to recover lost sales.

In a nutshell, the seeds that you sow now (abandoned cart recovery campaign) will bear fruit in the future (money and loyal customers).

Be it Shopify or WooCommerce, this is the basis for all platforms.

For now, in this blog post, let’s address some crucial information regarding cart abandonment and then later, I will walk you through the process of recovering a WooCommerce abandoned cart.

<toc></toc>

## What is cart abandonment?

Wife: “Honey, we are running out of pasta for tomorrow’s party. Can you please place an order that gets delivered by tomorrow morning?”

Husband: *Okie dokie. I am doing it right away.*

After 10 minutes.

Wife: *“Oh wait. Did you finish the purchase?”*

Husband: *“I was about to make the payment.”*

Wife: *“Let that be. Luckily, I found some pasta in the pantry. We had actually bought some extra last week. This would be sufficient for the guests.”*

Husband simply closes the tab where he had shopped for the pasta and goes on to browse something else.

The husband and wife have moved on but the cart with the pasta in it stays put without knowing what to do next. Sad.

This is cart abandonment. You shop for something online and leave it there without proceeding to the checkout.

This happens all over the world every single minute in the eCommerce sector. The scenario has to be different indeed.

This immediately gets you thinking.

## What are the other reasons for cart abandonment?

eCommerce sites have turned into a place where people simply while away time. The old ways of spending time in a park during leisure can be equated with today’s habit of shopping without need and purpose.

  

Shopping without the need or ‘just browsing’ is one reason that most shoppers have to say for cart abandonment. Besides this, there are many others and the trend keeps changing from time to time.

  

The below image shows cart abandonment reasons for a group of consumers studied in 2019 by Baymard Institute.

![reasons for cart abandonment](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/reasons-for-abandonment-during-checkout 2019 salecycle.png)


-   Extra costs too high
    

This reason stands at 55% - the one that has the most impact. Hidden charges that are levied on the consumer when shopping online sometimes literally double the actual price of the product bought. Hidden charges include shipping costs, tax, and others. This in fact comes as a shock when it is revealed at the time of checkout leading to cartabandonment.

  

-   Had to create account
    

There are eCommerce sites that make account creation mandatory to purchase their products. This is totally absurd because no consumer would like to be forced into doing something. Moreover, although the step takes hardly a minute they view it as a big hindrance to proceed further.

  

-   Long or complex process
    

The checkout has to be as simple as possible. If you make the customer traverse through more than a page with unnecessary details, he just skips the checkout and goes on to shop elsewhere. A single-click checkout is what people usually expect.

  

-   Can’t see total cost
    

With 21% of people agreeing to this, it stands in 4th place of cart abandonment reasons. It so happens that some eCommerce stores do not display the total cost of items bought, including extra costs, upfront. They simply deduct it when the payment is done. Consumers always expect to keep them informed.

  

-   Didn’t trust site
    

Security is an all-time concern in this age of the internet, especially when it comes to data theft and money transactions. A basic internet user goes by how the site looks like and others look for trust badges and certificates in order to ensure safety. Consumers will never shop in a place where their data is at risk.

-   Website error or crashes
    

17% of people cite website crash as a reason for cart abandonment. With the whole world dependable on machines, this is sometimes unavoidable. The only thing that you can do to overcome this issue is to ensure regular maintenance checks are done.

  

-   Delivery too slow
    

This is a fast-paced world and product delivery should be the same way too. When the delivery date mentioned at the checkout is later than expected, consumers start thinking twice to checkout.

  

-   Returns policy
    

Some will not be able to locate the returns policy and most others might not find it convincing. Either way, you lose a customer when you don’t have a returns policy that is concrete. A consumer always looks for this during checkout and so make sure that it is right in front of them.

  

-   Lack of payment options
    

Preferences vary from person to person and so does online payment option. The more number of options you provide, the lesser will be your cart abandonment rate.

  

-   Card declined
    

Technical errors lead to this issue. Since a third party, the banks, are involved here, you can never really point a finger. It just happens.

  

## What cart abandonment rate is the eCommerce sector experiencing?

Cart abandonment rate is the metric that depicts the number of abandoned carts in percentage. This is how it is calculated.

  

**Cart abandonment rate = (Transactions initiated - Transactions completed) / Transactions initiated**

  

The global average cart abandonment rate stands at 75.6%.

  

Statistics show that the cart abandonment rate has only increased gradually over the years even when different types of marketing strategies are implemented.

  

It is vital to calculate the cart abandonment rate for your store and to know in general the scenario your competitors are going through. This will help you to plan better to face reality.

  

Take a look at the industry-specific cart abandonment rates collected by Statista in 2018.

  

![cart abandonment rate](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/abandonment_by_industry.png)

  

The cart abandonment rates vary across industries with the highest for Travel and the lowest for Fashion. This shows that no one is spared. Cart abandonment rate haunts every industry = vand you are not alone.

  

## Why is abandoned cart recovery important?

There is no use in keeping abandoned carts at bay. If done so, they simply rust and become useless, neither helping themselves nor others.

  

On the other hand, if you take the stand to deal with them intelligently, you get dual benefits.

  

**1.  Recover pots of gold, not just carts**
    

For example, say your store makes a revenue of $500 on an average per day and $300 worth of cart is abandoned on a daily basis. You have planned to put in some effort to retrieve the carts. Let’s say the recovery campaign has not been successful as expected but could recover a meager $100 every day.

  

Revenue for a month = $15,000.

Revenue from abandoned carts/per month = $3000 (a week’s revenue)

  

So, even with the small number of recovered carts, the overall impact is positive and you will definitely want to do better with the abandoned carts.

  

**2.  Strengthen customer relationships**
    

You are in fact lending the customer a helping hand to complete the purchase by using cart recovery techniques. It turns out that he might notice the sincere effort that you put in to win him back.

  

Make the customer realize his worth through your cart recovery campaign and get a loyal customer in turn. By this, you pave the way for a long-term relationship with him.

  

There is only one thing I wish to tell you, my friend.

  

You are leaving some money on the table and compromising on retaining your customer if you hesitate to take the reins now.

  

## Which is the best method to recover a cart?

There are numerous ways in which a cart can be recovered. With improving technology, many other ways are being invented.

  

Do you know which one to opt for to get optimum results? This section will give you an insight.

  

### 1.  Exit-intent popups
    

Popups have gained so much popularity from the time it was first implemented. A message pops up to entice you back into finishing the purchase when you are about to leave the page. There can be a special discount for you too. It does work for many businesses. It allows to retrieve the cart without much delay.

  

Exit-intent popups have a downside that nothing can be done if the customer ignores it and closes the page. Another exit-intent cannot be shown. The effectiveness of the popup has its virtual limits.

  

### 2.  Retargeting ads
    

This is quite common nowadays. You add a product to the cart and carry on with some other work. You might have definitely noticed the advertisement of the abandoned product coming up in all the pages you browse. It is usually accompanied by a discount offer.

  

The problem here is that firstly, no other exquisite details can be included here to convince the customer genuinely. Secondly, what if you are not browsing? Will someone knock at your door with the ad material of the product?

  

### 3.  Push notifications
    

Push notifications are of two types - web and app. It is a concise but effective way of delivering cart abandonment reminders. Variety of content can be included and browser activity is not mandatory to receive push notifications. This is, without doubt, an advantage compared to retargeting ads and exit-intent popups.

  

The problem is that the future of push notifications is uncertain. It cannot be used by everyone like emails. Imagine if all the sites that you have shopped with start sending push notifications. There would not be anything more annoying than this. So, push notifications will exist but with limited reach for usage. It will never take the top spot.

  

### 4.  Cart abandonment emails
    

Emails have existed right from the start of the computer revolution. They are still going strong. The fact that there are <link-text url="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf"   rel="noopener noopener" target="_blank">3.9 billion active email users worldwide</link-text> seconds this. Social media users take the next place at 3.5 billion.

  

**Advantages of using cart abandonment email**

-   Can be sent when there is no browser activity.
    
-   It is not restricted to a particular device.
    
-   Unlimited number of emails can be sent out.
    
-   It does not annoy the recipient as the message can be viewed at a later time, unlike other forms of cart recovery.
    
-   A personal connection can be established with the customer with the help of content that empathizes, promotes, gives an offer, and convinces to purchase again.
    
-   The number of elements that can be used in an email to entice the customer is more in number than other methods of cart recovery.
    
-   The future is bright as the <link-tetx url="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">number of email users by 2023 is estimated to touch 4.3 billion.</link-text>
    

  

This confirms that of all the four methods of cart recovery, email is the best because it will stand the test of time. Moreover, the advantages of the email clearly outweigh the advantages of others.

  

## Why is email still preferred by a majority of businesses?

As of 2018, <link-text url="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">81% of SMBs rely on emails to acquire customers and 80% for customer retention.</link-text> There you go. There cannot be any better proof which points out that email marketing is still the first choice for many businesses to grow their eCommerce empire.

  

This shows the importance of sending out WooCommerce cart recovery emails.

  

Now that you have realized the importance of abandoned cart recovery emails, let’s move on to the next question.

  

## How many abandoned cart emails would be ideal to bring back a customer?

This, in fact, must be decided on at the initial stages itself for a smoother workflow. The choice is up to you but experts say that 3 abandoned cart emails can create magic compared to one or two emails.

  

A study conducted by Omnisend in 2018 has proven this. The study revealed that 3 abandoned cart emails resulted in 69% more orders than a single email.

Data is prime when it comes to email marketing and it is the same for abandoned cart recovery too. Before devising a strategic plan to recover the WooCommerce abandoned carts, one must know the exact number and the potential revenue lost in addition to other related data.

The data is essential to knock at the doors of customers again and will give an insight into the gravity of the situation.

But where will you find it? Retainful has the answer to it.

  

### Checking for abandoned carts

An overview of the details of abandoned carts can be seen in the dashboard of Retainful.

  

Click on ‘Abandoned / Recovered Carts’ tab to see the data. You will find the following data.

  

The total (number of)

-   Abandoned Carts
    
-   Abandoned Amount
    
-   Recovered Carts
    
-   Recovered Amount
    

  

Some data that are specific to carts are displayed too. They include

-   Id
    
-   Cart Status
    
-   Date of abandonment
    
-   Customer IP
    
-   Email

This dashboard of Retainful will tell you what is the current situation and will give you an idea on how to take things forward.

![Checking for abandoned carts](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/Retainful-dashboard.png)

  

----------

  

There are some settings that need to be finalized prior to starting the cart recovery. This is mandatory, without which the Retainful plugin will not keep a tab on the abandoned / recovered carts.

### Configuration

Go to the ‘Settings’ tab of Retainful to do this.

  

![Configuration](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/1.png)

  

The following details must be given importance.

  

**Time after which the cart is considered abandoned**

This is of most importance to consider a cart as abandoned. The cart will be considered abandoned if it is inactive after the time mentioned in this field. Here the example is given as 60 minutes.

  

**Number of days to wait to delete the cart**

Cart recovery is not always a success. It happens that some abandoned carts remain in the database forever and get piled up. To avoid this, the cart will get deleted automatically from the plugin if it is not recovered after the time mentioned here. Here the example is given as 90 days.

**Notification for cart recovery**

It is obvious that you might want to know when a cart is recovered. This feature does this work. When enabled ‘yes’, you will get notified of a recovered cart.

**Real-time cart tracking**

Live tracking of all carts is possible with this. You can see who and what people are adding to their carts with this is enabled.

  

**Display of guest cart**

It is recommended to keep this enabled because abandoned guest carts also hold back some revenue just like the logged-in users.

**Compliance message**

This is mandatory if plan to track real-time carts. Letting people know about this with a message is the ethical way of doing it as per the GDPR law.

  

Save the inputs given.

  

----------

  

Now, the real game starts. This is where you can falter with the blink of an eye. Watch out and test different methods and strategies to reach out to your customers.

  

### The Cart recovery process

This is the most important stage of the whole lot and can be broken down into three sections.
They are

-   How to create an email template
    
-   How to write cart recovery emails
    
-   The best sequence for recovery campaigns
    

Come, let’s learn about each of it in detail.

## How to create an email template

In the Retainful plugin, click on ‘Email Templates’ tab and enter the sender details 

From Name - The sender’s name that must appear in the email

From Address - The email ID used for sending out cart recovery emails.

Reply To Address - The email ID to which the customer must reply.
 

![How to create an email template](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/2.png)
 

After this step, simply save the information.

### The First Email

To start with, click on ‘Create New Email Template’ CTA from the ‘Email Templates’ tab.
 

![The First Email](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/image.png)
 

You are taken to the ‘Add or Edit Email Template’ page. 

Enter the following details.

 **Template Name**

This is purely for your sake to identify the templates. Let us name our maiden email as ‘First Email’.  

**Template Subject**

This is what gives the first impression - the subject line. Give it your best shot here. We have given it as ‘Where have you been?. This creates a curiosity to click open the email.  

**Send this email in**

The number that you mention here is of prime importance because the timing of an email is as equally significant as the content. We have given it as 1hour. So, the first email will be sent one hour after the cart abandonment.

**Send a test email to**

A final look at how the email will appear when the customer views it. This is optional.


![Send a test email to](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/3.png)

  

![](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/4.png)


**Email body**

Keep it simple for the first email. Just plain text with an enticing image - all of this without using a template. 

Things to take note of in the email

-   **The image**           
 It is so colorful and welcoming. The chosen image is in sync with the subject line ‘Where have you been?’

-   **Personalization**             
Personalization takes your email a notch higher because it indicates friendliness and concern. This email uses ‘Ryan’ as the customer name. When the email is automated to be sent to multiple people, {{customer_name}} - a short code can be used. This will automatically include the customer name from the cart details.

-   **Cart details**                
This is just a reminder for the reader to reignite the spark to complete the checkout.

-   **Link to cart**                
The hyperlink is highlighted in contrasting color so that it gets noticed similar to a CTA.

-   **Incentive**               
The email body also emphasizes on an undisclosed incentive at the checkout. This also, just like the cart recovery link, is highlighted.

![Email body](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/5.png)


This first email proves that the WYSIWYG  editor of Retainful is so flexible and any kind of email can be drafted.  

Save the template created and you will be taken back to the ‘Edit Template’ page where the details of the first email created will have been updated.

  

![First Email](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/6.png)

  

Repeat the same process for the second and third emails too.

### The Second Email

The details of the email are the following.


Template Name - Second Email
Template Subject - {{customer_name}}, your cart is still waiting.
Send this email in - 3hours

**Email Body**

![The Second Email](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/7.png)

This second email is drafted with the help of an email template available in Retainful. This is the next level after just plain content in the first email.

Things to take note of in the second email

-   **Logo**                
There is a provision in this template to include the company logo. The size can be adjusted.

-   **Chat option**                 
The availability of the live chat option will make the customer react instantly by connecting to the chat if there is any issue.

-   **Headline**            
The headline poses a question that sets the customer thinking It is also personalized with the short code.

-   **Image**               
The image is that of the product in the cart with the mention of the price and the star rating. The star rating helps remind the customer of the quality of the product chosen and assures that he has made the right choice.

-   **Incentive**               
An offer is always irresistible. So, give one when you want your customer to <link-text url="http://blogcd.com/how-to-check-cart-abandonment-in-woocommerce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out the abandoned carts.</link-text>

-   **CTA**             
The CTA says ‘Grab It Now’. The text can be changed to anything that you prefer by clicking on the CTA and choosing the edit option.

Now, the ‘Edit Template’ page will look like this.

![Email Templates](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/8.png)

  

### The Third Email

Here are the details.

Template Name - Third Email
Template Subject - The sale is coming to a close {{customer_name}}. Not much time left to save your cart.
Send this email in - 24hours

**Email Body**

Here again, a template available in the Premium version of Retainful has been used for the third email.

  

![The Third Email](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/9.png)
  

Things to note in the third email

-   **Content**             
The content creates a sense of urgency to act fast. It also mentions the time left to save the cart.

-   **Design**              
The design is captivating and demands attention, especially with the hues.

-   **CTA**             
There are two CTAs if you have noticed. One reason for 2 CTAs is convenience and the second is that it sends out a message to the customer to act fast immediately.

The ‘Edit Template’ page after creating the 3 emails will look like this
  

![](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/10.png)


All the three emails created are enabled as shown above and gets triggered automatically when a cart abandonment takes place.

----------

## How to write abandoned cart recovery emails

Drafting cart recovery emails is an art. It is not just the content that matters. There are various other aspects to it. Take a look.

The email elements that must be given prime importance are:

-   **Subject line**                
A study says that 35% of people open emails based on the subject line. There are <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/13-best-subject-lines-for-abandoned-cart-email-campaigns" rel="noopener" target="_blank">different types of subject lines</link-text> like FOMO, scarcity, emoji, and many others. This has to interest the email recipient to take things forward from thereon.

Eg: Did you leave something behind?

Your bottle of wine is waiting in the cart!

Would you like an offer?

-   **Product image**               
It is always a wise decision to include the image of the product in the cart details. This is to remind the potential buyer about the abandoned product. Pictures stay in memory than the names. 

-   **A clear CTA**             
The CTA button must be highlighted in the cart abandonment email because ultimately, you want the reader to proceed to checkout. It should also be linked directly to the cart. If the CTA is not visible and hard to spot, the very purpose of it is lost.

-   **Pleasing design**             
The aesthetic aspect of an email is also a very important factor. You will never feel like going through an email that is crammed in. There must be some enough white space in the background. When there are splendid colors in there, they must blend in very well and make it visually pleasing.

-   **Enticing copy**           
The writing in the email is sometimes overlooked at. Sometimes, writing alone has the power to recover a cart when done the right way. Use a language style that your customer base connects with very easily. You can also project the characteristics of your brand through writing.

-   **Contact details**                 
You must be around within the customer’s reach. The details of your contact must be mentioned so that the customer can get in touch in case of any issues or queries. Give a live chat option if available or display a toll-free number.

Secondary elements that make an abandoned cart email more worthy of conversion are:

-  **A discount**                
This is what people want to be exact. This does not mean that you need to include the offer in all your WooCommerce abandoned cart emails. Adding the offer to the second email in the sequence is the best idea ever. This is a sure-fire method to get back the customer.

-   **Product recommendations**         
 You have the liberty to recommend other products in the email. They can be either complementary or products of the same category. This will ensure that the potential customer will resume shopping if he is uninterested in the abandoned product.

-   **Social proof**            
People are always interested to know about product reviews and testimonials. Cart abandonment emails can be used as a platform to showcase them in order to build confidence to make a purchase.


Take a look at some abandoned cart email examples.

**1.  Email from Kate Spade**
    
![Email from Kate Spade](../images/how-to-recover-abandoned-checkouts-in-woocommerce/kate-spade-woocommerce.jpg)


Though having a monochrome tone, Kate Spade has nailed the email with few but essential elements. It has two links to the cart, an image, and incentives. It is so simple and neat that you will for sure take your time to read it.

**2. Email from Chubbies Shorts**

Here comes an email from Chubbies Shorts. They exhibit exquisite talent in crafting cart recovery emails, especially with their copy.

“Lemme Teleport You Back To Your Cart. Free Of Charge.

Allow me to transport you back to your internet shopping cart.

Teleport To Your Cart.”

All of the phrases above are the ones that catch the attention. One aspect to be noted here is that the intention of the copy throughout the email is the same - to take the customer back to the cart. The gentle request manifests as an order in the readers’ mind when repeated thrice. You must be an alien if you hesitate to click the CTA in this email.

## Best sequence for abandoned cart email campaigns

Do you have a preconceived notion that there is just one time sequence that works for all cart recovery campaigns?


Your mind is traversing the wrong path if you think so.


You can choose the best time sequence for your eCommerce store but not for the sector as a whole. This is because each store is unique in the way it functions and deals with things.

Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the best time to send the first abandoned cart email is 1hour after abandonment.

A study by <link-text url="http://rejoiner.com/resources/abandoned-cart-email-timing/"   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rejoiner</link-text>  has proved this.

The graph below shows that the conversion rate is the highest when the first emails are sent after an hour of abandonment.

 Most people do follow this because sending the first email any sooner might irk the customer.

Even so, <link-text url="https://blog.recart.com/how-i-generated-103271-by-reducing-cart-abandonment/"   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Recart</link-text> had managed to get an open rate of 61% by sending the first email just 10 minutes after abandonment.

Let’s look at it in brief.

**Example 1:**

Recart was experimenting with abandoned cart emails and tried various email sequences. They found out that the best sequence that worked for them was 10minutes-24hours-72hours. They reported that they could make $103, 271 with this method in a year.

Here is another success story.

**Example 2:**

<link-text url="https://www.shopify.in/partners/blog/how-to-build-an-abandoned-cart-email-sequence"   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BOOM By Cindy Joseph</link-text> too did something different. They sent out their first email 4 hours after cart abandonment and made a revenue of $19.6k in one month. The email sequence was 4 hours - 24 hours - 2 days - 4 days - 5 days - 6 days.

Oh, yes. They managed to send 6 emails rather than the usual 3. This is very rare to find and these were the revenue for the emails per month

Email 1 - $19.6K, Email 2 - $9.02k, Email 3 - $1.19k, Email 4 - $5k, Email 5 - $784.32, Email 6 - $3.25k


I personally feel 4 emails would suffice looking at the revenue recovered. 6 emails is a lot to handle.

**Example 3:**

Mark D. Hall, a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) professional, when working on projects concluded the following to be the best email sequence of the lot.

<link-text url="https://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/capture-more-abandoned-carts-with-this-email-sequence/"   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Immediately after abandonment - 24 hours - 7 days</link-text>. The timing of all the emails is as close enough to the time the abandonment took place. This is completely different from the above two examples.

With this, it can be concluded that the sequences vary a lot depending on the businesses. To generalize, one can choose to abide by the time sequence given below.


1st email - immediately to 4 hours after abandonment

2nd email - 24 hours after abandonment

3rd email - 3 days to 7 days

----------

Do you think you are done with the abandoned cart recovery process? If so, this is just for the time being. More carts to be abandoned are on the way and the best way to know about them is to keep yourself informed.

### Monitoring

How do you know that carts have been abandoned and some have been recovered?

This is where monitoring comes into play.

Here, again, you have to use the dashboard to look at information related to carts.

When there is cart abandonment activity, the dashboard will look like the below image with extra details of cart status, customer IP, and email.

A comprehensive dashboard like this allows you, as the WooCommerce store owner, to decide on how to take the cart abandonment campaign forward and bring about changes in due course to get better results.

## Points to remember

Put into practice the following points to get good cart recovery campaign results.

-   Act immediately when a cart is abandoned
Do not keep things for tomorrow when you see an abandoned cart. Implement the planned strategy right away else you will lose your customer in no time.

-   Don’t force it
Cart abandonment emails must act as a gentle reminder and not as an order to which the customer must respond. Things might slip out of your hands if you are being compulsive.

-   Concentrate on guest-users too
Guest users must never be ignored because they too hold back more revenue just like users with accounts. It is also a chance to grow the email list.

-   Use data wisely to send out emails
Emails work better when they are sent at a particular time and day of the week. There are various other parameters too based on which data can be collected like repeat buyers and location. Of course, this varies for different businesses. So, this must be monitored closely and the data must be put to use the right way to reap benefits.

-   **Segment the user base**           
If you are dealing with cart recovery for the first time, it is advised to divide your user base so as to test different strategies. This saves time and will help you choose the best idea.

-   **Think out of the box**                
  Conventional ways of thinking sometimes hit a roadblock. Dare to be different to stand out from the crowd. Break the rules and go out of the way to reach out to your customer base.

-   **Test..test...test**                  
    This is the most important of all. Never mind if you are a start-up or a company with offices all over the globe, you have to keep experimenting and testing what works and what doesn’t. This is a continual process that helps uncover some mind-blowing ways to retain a customer.
 
## Closing thoughts…

Cart abandonment issues must be addressed without much delay. The earlier the better. Don’t forget the fact that you can still rely on emails for cart recovery.
