This mainly involves optimizing your website contents to match what is being commonly searched on the internet which is called on-page SEO.

Hence this can be used as a keyword in your site so that when potential buyers search for this your site can be found by them. Now the more you are searched the higher will be your site ranking. And SEO is all about using different hacks to rank higher in the search engine.

But you cannot do SEO today and expect its benefits tomorrow as it takes a substantial amount of time. A rightly done white hat SEO can take a few months to show consistent results.

#### Black Friday Ads

The unpaid organic ways of promotions are systematic and take a lot of time and quality efforts. In this scenario, you can use paid promotions like posting advertisements on different platforms. Advertisements help to quickly promote your sales during the sale season.
