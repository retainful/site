## 3. Paying heed to your customers
All your customers expect from you is to pay attention to them whenever there is an issue. Lend an ear when a customer contacts you. It might be complaints or suggestions. Manage Customer expectations. Don't take eternities to respond to any sort of complaints. Their problems or issues should be solved at the drop of a hat.

Introduce <link-text url="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">loyalty programs to your loyal customers</link-text> who are in constant merchandise with you. Show your love and gratitude by giving them coupons and discounts. You know, **a happy customer brings 10 more customers.**

## 4. Punctuality and Credibility above all

Timely service is the key to making the way straight to the heart of your audience. Most of the e-commerce owners don't consider this to be an important aspect but this matters equally like the others. Delay in anything, be it the delivery of your services or responding to a query will drive your customers away. Stick with the virtues of punctuality and credibility. Provide credible services on time. 

Treat your customers like your best buddy. Be kind and gentle rather being authoritative. Don't waste your customers valuable time. When you are explaining something to them, cut to the chase. Beating around the bush will waste both interest and time.

## 5.  Customer mapping

Map out your journey with your customer. Tell them about your growth that happened solely because of them. Gift them with special offers and deals for things you have achieved because of them. This <link-text url="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strategy makes your business as easy as an icing on the cake.</link-text>

Put Customer referrals and discounts on frequent effects. You can never stop impressing your customers. Nor will they deny any discounts or gift vouchers. **A statistics conducted by US Small Business Administration says, 32% of your customers stay put if you provide them with the satisfactory service they expect.**

E-commerce business is ruling the world and there will be a time when it will stand ahead of everything in the race of business. Come hell or high water, face all difficulties and drag your store to success. Your store should always have two-way communication: Customer-owner. Make customer service your priority & see things falling right into place as you expect.

Go Retaining!
