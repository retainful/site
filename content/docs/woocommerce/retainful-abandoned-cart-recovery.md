More than 69% of the shoppers abandon their carts. But with a well-timed email follow-ups, it is possible to recover at least 39% of them.

Retainful comes with awesome cart recovery features, which helps you send automatic follow-up emails and recover the carts.

This guide walks you through the process of creating **a sequence of Abandoned Cart Recovery Emails in your WooCommerce store**.

### Step 1:Basic configuration

Go to your WordPress Dashboard -> WooCommerce -> Retainful -> Settings tab.

The tab allows you to set up things like
- When to consider a cart abandoned
- How many days to wait before deleting an abandoned cart 
and more.

![Setting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retainful/site-images/master/docs/abandoned-cart-recovery/setting.png)

The following two are the most important settings you may want to adjust or you can leave them to defaults

**When to consider a cart as abandoned?** 

Set the time period when to consider the cart left with products as Abandoned Cart. 
Let us say, when a cart is left 30mins with the products can be considered as abandoned cart

**How many days to wait before automatically deleting the cart?**

A maximum number of days to keep track of the cart and when can the items in the cart can be deleted.
Example: 100Days
Also, you can set if the store admin wants to be notified when cart is recovered by the User here.
Type the compliance Message to show when tracking real-time carts using.

###Step 2: Create an Email Sequence / Follow-ups

Go to WordPress Dashboard -> WooCommerce -> Retainful -> Email Templates tab

Retainful helps you create unlimited number of emails that can be sent in a sequence automatically.

**Example of an email sequence:**

- Send an email 1 hour after customer abandons the cart
- Do another email follow-up 3 hours after the cart is abandoned
- Remind the customer again 1 day after the abandonment
- Still not recovered, send one more reminder 2nd day.

Once this sequence is created, Retainful will automatically execute this sequence when a customer abandons the cart. 
NOTE: You can set up the interval and customize the sequence in anyway you wanted.

Whenever the cart is recovered, the sequence will automatically stop for that particular customer. So you do not have to worry about it.

**Template Name** - An identifier for the template. You can give a name for it. 

**Template Subject** - Subject to be used for this email. For example: We saved your cart! 

**Email Body** - Use the Wysisyg editor to design the email body. By default, we provide a simple, elgant template design. But you are free to change the body content. If you are an advanced user, you can click on the **Text** field to see the HTML code and edit directly there as well.

Retainful provides the following short codes that can be inserted in the email body to include dynamic data and for personalisation.

Example: You can include the customer's cart contents and a recovery link
