Sometimes, you might wish to reward users with Next order coupons. So, it becomes necessary to know how the coupons work. 
Let's do some testing to understand the workflow.

### Receiving next order coupons

Once you have set up next order coupons on your site and placed a test order on the store, you will be receiving an email like this:

### Availing next order coupons

1. Click on the Go button below the coupon code and you would be taken to the store.

2. Add a product to the cart and click on the view cart button.

3. Once you visit the cart page, the coupon would be applied based on the restrictions and configuration set at the Retainful plugin.
