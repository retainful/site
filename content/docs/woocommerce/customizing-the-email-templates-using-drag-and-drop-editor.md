Customizing your abandoned cart email templates has never been so easy. With Retainful, you could easily drag and drop the desired elements onto the template body of your mails.

This article illustrates how you could customize email templates using Retainful.

### Customizing email templates

Login to your Retainful account. Click on **Emails->Email templates->Choose a template or create a new one**.

#### Adding a new block

At the email template layout, you could see a pre-defined template. The tools for customisation are available at the far right corner of the Retainful dashboard as follows:

![Available options](../../images/docs/customizing-templates-using-editor/blocks-available.png)

1. **Section tab** - Divide and Conquer!
Divide the email into neat columns.
In this part, you can find tools that allow you to add segments to your email template, for example, if you wish to divide the template layout into 2 or 3 columns, you could drag and drop blocks from this section.

![Section tab](../../images/docs/customizing-templates-using-editor/section-columns.png)
This is how the template layout can be segmented with the use of tools in the section tab:

2. **Element tab**- This section helps you add new text blocks, buttons, images, divider and so on.

<call-out>

1. A clear CTA encourages users to complete the abandoned purchase. If you are looking to add <highlight>call-to-action buttons</highlight> on your recovery emails, you could do so by using the button block.

2.  Avoid customer frustruation. Send GDPR-compliant abandoned cart emails. This can be done with the Unsubscribe button element. The other store emails would still be delivered.

3.  Some users might have abandoned their cart because they had questions and didn't know where to get them answered. Why not make use of the recovery mails to do that? Use the Text block to answer FAQs.

3. **Store block**- Every abandoned cart email should have certain elements like:
- The brand's logo
- The cart items
- The price of the order
- A discount coupon(at the right time)
Here is how you could add these elements on your recovery emails.

You could also customise and add styles to the individual sections of the email template. Let us learn more about this on the next section.

#### Editing individual elements of the email 

If you wish to apply styles like changing the color, font-size, dimensions of a particular section, that can be done by clicking on that particular segment. 
When you click on a particular segment, a blue rectangle appears around the element or block. 
And the options to customise the layout appear on the right corner.

1. Choose the block of the element you wish to customize further. A blue rectangle would appear.
