Post installing the Retainful plugin on your site, the next step is to get your store connected to your Retainful account.

### Connecting the store with Retainful

#### For version 1.x
For those, who use Retainful plugin with version 1.x, please follow the below steps to connect the store with your Retainful account:

1. **Fetching the keys:** Login to your Retainful dashboard by clicking <link-text url="https://app.retainful.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here<link-text>
If you are a new user, you could sign up as well.

4. **Adding the keys to store and validating them:** As far as Version 1.x is concerned, you would need only the APP ID and not the secret key. So copy the App ID alone.

5. On your store's dashboard, click on Woocommerce ->Retainful-Abandoned carts -> License and add the App ID, click the connect button.
