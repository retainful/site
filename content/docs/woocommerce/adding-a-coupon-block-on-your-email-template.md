Coupon based discounts play a crucial role in driving sales on your store. You could encourage users to resume their abandoned purchase by offering them a discount.
Retainful allows you to add coupon blocks on your abandoned cart email templates easily using an intuitive drag and drop editor. 

This guide explains how you could add a coupon discount block on your cart recovery email templates.

> NOTE: This is a PREMIUM Feature. Make sure that you have activated the Premium add on of Retainful.

### Adding a coupon block on your email template using Retainful

For those who use Retainful plugin 2.x and have migrated to cloud, you could add a coupon discount to your recovery emails by following the process below.

#### Step-1: Create a coupon

1. You will have to create a coupon on your site. Navigate to **Woocommerce->Coupons**. Click **Add coupon**.

#### Step-2: Adding the coupon code to your mail template on Retainful account

1. Login to the Retainful account that you have connected with your store.
2. Navigate to Emails->Your email template->Edit. Or you could create a new template as well. 
3. The coupon block can be found on the right hand side under the **Store elements** block.

> Note: Post adding the coupon code, edit the text block as per your discount conditions. In our example, we set up a flat 25% discount on our Woocommerce store. So let us not forget to modify the text accordingly.

6. Make sure that you **Activate the template** and **Save**.

Tada! We have now set up the coupon discount for the abandoned cart email template. Users can claim these coupon discounts by clicking on the **Shop Now** button found below the coupon code.
