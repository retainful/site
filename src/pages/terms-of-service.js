                                    Retainful may modify these Terms of Service or any policy or other terms referenced
                                    in these Terms of Service including but not limited to the Privacy Policy and, if
                                    applicable, the EU Data Protection Addendum (collectively, “<strong>Additional
                                    Policies</strong>“) at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms of Service
                                    and the Additional Policies on the Retainful Site. Unless otherwise set forth in
                                    these Terms of Service, the revised terms shall be effective (a) fifteen (15) days
                                    after posting and/or notifying Customers of the changes (including through a notice
                                    submitted by Retainful to an Authorized Reseller to be then passed along to a
                                    Customer); or (b) upon Customer’s acceptance if Retainful or an Authorized Reseller
                                    provides a mechanism for Customer’s immediate acceptance of the revised terms, such
                                    as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button, whichever occurs first.
                                    Continued performance by Retainful of its obligations hereunder is adequate

                                    Additional Policies, Customer agrees to be bound by the revised Terms of Service or
                                    any revised Additional Policies. It is Customer’s responsibility to check the
                                    websites listed herein regularly for changes to these Terms of Service or the
                                    Additional Policies, as applicable. If Customer disagrees with any modifications to

                                    the receipt of Services in accordance with Section 12 herein.

                                    Retainful, or if Customer purchases a right to use the Service from an Authorized
                                    Reseller, then Customer will pay to such Authorized Reseller, all Services fees

                                    the Fees. Retainful or Authorized Reseller will provide Customer fourteen (14) days
                                    advance notice for any increase in fees or addition of new fees for any existing
                                    Services. Customer’s continued use of the Services after a fee increase will
                                    constitute Customer’s agreement to the increase in service fees.

                                    Retainful, or if applicable, the Authorized Reseller, will, using Stripe (or other
                                    third party payment processors), charge Customer the Fees and applicable taxes for

                                    of such billing period. If Customer is paying by credit card or eCheck, (a) Customer

                                    to charge the credit card or other payment method provided for any such amounts when
                                    due, (b) amounts due will be automatically charged, in advance, and (c) if
                                    Customer’s credit card expires, Customer hereby gives Retainful, or if applicable,
                                    the Authorized Reseller, permission to submit the credit card charge with a later
                                    expiration date. All billing disputes must be emailed to support@retainful.com
                                    within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the billing statement, and disputes not
                                    made within that time are waived by Customer. Late payments, including those
                                    resulting from credit card declines that the Customer has attempted to follow up on
                                    hereunder will accrue interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1 1/2 %) per
                                    month, or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower. Retainful,
                                    or if applicable, the Authorized Reseller, reserves the right to have Customer
                                    complete a credit application to determine Customer’s creditworthiness as a
                                    condition of receiving further Services. If Retainful, or if applicable, the
                                    Authorized Reseller, must initiate a collections process to recover Fees due and
                                    payable hereunder, then Retainful, or if applicable, the Authorized Reseller, shall
                                    be entitled to recover from Customer all costs associated with such collections
                                    efforts, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees. In the event
                                    Retainful, or if applicable, the Authorized Reseller, delivers to Customer an
                                    invoice for any Fees or interest payments owed hereunder, such invoiced amounts
                                    shall be due within fourteen (14) days of the date of such invoice. In the event an
                                    account is past due and Customer requests to cancel per Section 12, Customer is
                                    required to pay for the month of service from their initial bill date decline.

                                    In connection with Retainful’s performance of the Services, Retainful may collect
                                    online data from Customer or an Authorized Reseller and through the Retainful
                                    Platform regarding Customer’s customers (the “<strong>End Customer Data</strong>“).
                                    Further, Customer acknowledges that such End Customer Data may include personal
                                    information of Customer’s customers as well as data relating to Communications.
                                    Retainful will not use such End Customer Data for any purpose other than to provide

                                    inactive due to past-due amounts, Customer agrees that Retainful may delete all End

                                    Retainful agrees that it shall forward any such individual requests that it receives
                                    to Customer and shall reasonably assist Customer, at Customer’s request and expense,
                                    to satisfy such obligations. Customer agrees that it may be necessary for Retainful
                                    to access End Customer Data to respond to Customer’s request for assistance with any
                                    technical problems and/or queries. Customer shall hold Retainful, its
                                    subcontractors, suppliers and licensors harmless from any and all privacy or data
                                    protection claims relating to such access. Retainful may transfer End Customer Data
                                    to its successor or acquirer in a merger, acquisition or other consolidation,
                                    including without limitation the sale of all or substantially all of Retainful’s

                                    at the end of such Term.

                                    Notification of of such non-renewal from Customer to Retainful must be emailed to
                                    support@retainful.com, which must be confirmed by Retainful. If Customer chooses not
                                    to renew, Customer must fully notify Retainful in writing at least [48 business
                                    hours] prior to the Renewal Term, in which case, Customer will continue to have
                                    access to the Services and be billed until the end of the then current term.
                                    Customer shall not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Term. In the case
                                    Customer fails to fully notify Retainful of its intent not to renew within this
                                    time, the Renewal Term will commence at the end of the then-current term and
                                    Customer is responsible for the payment of Fees for the Services rendered for that
                                    Renewal Term. Customer shall not in any event be entitled to any refund of any Fees
                                    previously paid to Retainful for Services.

                                    Retainful shall have the right to terminate these Terms of Service at any time
                                    without cause and without notice. In addition, Retainful may terminate these Terms
                                    of Service upon written notice to Customer (or upon written notice provided to an
                                    Authorized Reseller and then passed along by an Authorized Reseller to a Customer)
                                    if Customer becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any proceeding
                                    relating to insolvency, receivership, or liquidation for the benefit of creditors.
                                    Upon a termination by Retainful without cause, Customer may be entitled to a
                                    pro-rata refund of any pre-paid and unused Fees advanced to Retainful.
                                </p>

                                    In the event of a credit card decline, Retainful, or if applicable, an Authorized
                                    Reseller, will attempt to reach out to Customer for a new payment method. If
                                    Retainful or, if applicable, an Authorized Reseller, fail to resolve the issue with
                                    Customer, the account will be terminated due to non-payment and Retainful will
                                    attempt to collect on any past due balances at Customer’s expense. Per Section 4.2,
                                    in the event Customer, or if applicable, an Authorized Reseller, requests to cancel
                                    with a past due balance, Customer is required to pay for the month of service from
                                    their initial bill date decline.
                                </p>

                                    Upon termination of these Terms of Service or the Service for any reason, Customer
                                    shall cease to use the Retainful Platform, the Services and Documentation. Retainful
                                    retains the right to terminate Customer’s access to any Retainful Platform and
                                    Services in the event of termination by either party.

                                    In the event of a temporary suspension of Customer’s access to Services,
                                </p>

                                        applicable Fees will continue to accrue. In the event of the termination of
                                        these Terms of Service, Customer may, upon reasonable notice to Retainful, elect
                                        to retrieve Customer Data directly. If these Terms of Service are terminated for
                                        any reason other than Customer’s breach, Retainful will not take any action to
                                        intentionally erase or delete Customer Data stored on the Services for a period
                                        of sixty (60) days. If these Terms of Service are terminated on account of
                                        Customer’s breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Service, Retainful will
                                        not take any action to intentionally erase or delete Customer Marketing Content
                                        or Customer Data stored on the Services for a period of [fifteen (15) days, or
                                        for sixty (60) days with respect to customer Communications as discussed above].
                                        In each case, Customer’s post-termination retrieval or transfer of Customer Data
                                        will be conditioned on Retainful’s receipt of all applicable Fees for the period
                                        following termination, payment in full of any other amounts owed, and Customer’s
                                        compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as Retainful may establish
                                        with respect to such retrieval or transfer. In addition, if Customer utilizes
                                        the professional services of Retainful to assist Customer in connection with
                                        such retrieval or transfer, Customer will be responsible for Retainful’s then
                                        current charges for such professional services. In the event that Retainful does
                                        not receive all such Fees and amounts due within the applicable time periods
                                        described above, or in the event that Customer fails to notify Retainful of
                                        Customer’s election with respect to the retrieval or transfer of Customer Data
                                        within such period, Retainful shall have no obligation to continue to store

                                <p>
                                    Retainful shall have the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time,
                                    effective upon posting of an updated version of these Terms of Service at <a
                                    href="https://www.retainful.com/terms-of-service">https://www.retainful.com/terms-of-service</a>.
                                    Retainful shall use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with notice of changes to
                                    these Terms of Service (including, by submitting a notice to the applicable
                                    Authorized Reseller to be forwarded to Customer), but Customer is responsible for
                                    regularly checking the Retainful Site to be informed of such changes. Continued use
                                    of the Services after any such changes are posted shall constitute Customer’s
                                    agreement to such changes. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision
                                    hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or
                                    any other provision, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of such party to
                                    avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has or may have hereunder
                                    operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege.

                                <p>
                                    These Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Singapore
                                    without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, shall govern the interpretation
                                    and enforcement of the arbitration agreement discussed in section 14.12. Unless you
                                    and Retainful agree otherwise in writing, in the event that the arbitration
                                    agreement is found not to apply to you or a particular claim (except for small
                                    claims court actions), as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order,
                                    you agree that the claim will be resolved exclusively by the federal court in
                                    Singapore. You and Retainful agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
                                    courts located within Singapore for the purposes of litigating such claims. The
                                    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
                                    of Goods is expressly excluded. Your use of the Services may also be subject to
                                    other local, state, national, or international laws.

                                    Customer may not assign its rights or delegate any obligations hereunder without the
                                    express prior written consent of Retainful. Any assignment by Customer without the
                                    prior written consent of Retainful shall be null and void. Retainful may assign its
                                    rights or obligations hereunder without notice or consent; provided, however, that
                                    the Services shall continue to operate as specified in these Terms of Service. These
                                    Terms of Service shall inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and
                                    assigns.

                                    If either party is unable to perform any of its obligations hereunder (other than
                                    payment obligations) due to any act of God, fire, casualty, flood, war, strike,
                                    shortage or any other cause beyond its reasonable control, and if such party uses
                                    reasonable efforts to avoid such occurrence and minimize its duration and gives
                                    prompt notice to the other party, then the affected party’s performance shall be
                                    excused and the time for its performance shall be extended for the period of delay
                                    or inability to perform. If the force majeure continues for more than thirty (30)
                                    calendar days, then either party may terminate these Terms of Service for
                                    convenience upon written notice to the other party.

                                    In the event that any provision contained herein shall for any reason be held
                                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
                                    jurisdiction, to such extent such provision shall be deemed null and void and
                                    severed from these Terms of Service, and the remainder hereof shall remain in full
                                    force and effect and enforceable.

                                    In any claim, action or proceeding to enforce any right or obligation of the parties
                                    under these Terms of Service including, without limitation, relating to your use of
                                    our services, you hereby waive any right you may now have or hereafter possess to a
                                    trial by jury. Both parties agree to resolve any dispute either Party may have
                                    arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Retainful Services in
                                    good faith mediation. In the event no mutual agreement is made under mediation
                                    within sixty (60) days of notice of such dispute, the Parties have the right to
                                    resolve such dispute via arbitration in Singapore administered by the Singapore
                                    International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of
                                    the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in
                                    force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.. Even
                                    if allowed under SIAC Rules, no class or collective action or arbitration may be
                                    brought against Retainful hereunder unless required by applicable law. If either you
                                    or Retainful intends to seek arbitration under these terms of service, the party
                                    seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at
                                    least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Retainful should
                                    be sent as required by these Terms of Service. The notice must describe the nature
                                    of the claim and the relief being sought. If you and Retainful are unable to resolve
                                    our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for
                                    arbitration. The arbitration, information produced, and pre-and post-hearing
                                    proceedings will be confidential and any award shall not be used in any other case
                                    except to enforce the award itself.

                                <p>
                                    Any claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as
                                    a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative,
                                    multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“<strong>Class Action</strong>”). The
                                    parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If
                                    the claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator shall not have authority to
                                    combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to
                                    any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of
                                    this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be
                                    determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The
                                    parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury
                                    decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived,
                                    and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class
                                    action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the arbitration
                                    agreement in Section 14.12, if otherwise effective, shall be null and void. The
                                    arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
                                    individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                                    warranted by that party’s individual claim.
