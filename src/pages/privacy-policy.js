                    <li>To process your inquiries and otherwise deliver customer service;</li>
                    <li>To process your payments, we share and use Payment Information</li>
                    <li>To control unauthorized use or abuse of the Offerings and our other products and services, or otherwise
                        detect, investigate or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal;
                    </li>
                    <li>To analyze trends, administer or optimize the Offerings, monitor usage or traffic patterns (including to
                        track users’ movements around the Offerings) and gather demographic information about our user base as a
                        whole;
                    </li>
                    <li>To communicate directly with you, including by sending you newsletters, promotions and special offers or
                        information about new products and services. Your opt-out options for promotional communications are
                        described in Section (Your Controls and Choices);
                    </li>
                    <li>To deliver you advertising, including by serving and managing ads on the Offerings or on third party
                        sites and to tailor ads based on your interests and browsing history. Please see Section (Your Controls
                        and Choices) for additional information on how to manage the ads you see; and
                    </li>
                    <li>In the manner described to you at the time of collection or as otherwise described in this Privacy
                        Policy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you visit our Sites or online services, both we and certain third parties collect information about your
                    online activities over time and across different sites to provide you with advertising about products and
                    services tailored to your individual interests (this type of advertising is called “interest-based
                    advertising”). These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie or other technology on your
                    browser (including the use of pixel tags). Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent
                    prior to processing of your information for the purpose of interest-based advertising.</p>
                <p>You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad
                    networks allow us to target our messaging to users based on a range of factors, including demographic data,
                    users’ inferred interests and browsing context (for example, the time and date of your visit to our Sites,
                    the pages that you viewed, and the links that you clicked on). This technology also helps us track the
                    effectiveness of our marketing efforts and understand if you have seen one of our advertisements.</p>
                <p>We work with Google AdWords and other advertising networks. To learn how to opt out of behavioral advertising
                    delivered by Network Advertising Initiative member companies, please visit the <a

                    interest-based advertising, you may see advertising that is not relevant to you. At present, there is no
                    industry standard for recognizing Do Not Track browser signals, so we do not respond to them.</p>
                <h3>4. How We Disclose Personal Data.</h3>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, share or transfer your personal information to third parties. We share your Personal

                <h4>a. Cartrabbit.</h4>
                <p>We share Personal Data with other Cartrabbit entities in order to provide our Services and for internal
                    administration purposes.</p>
                <h4>b. Service providers.</h4>
                <p>We share Personal Data with a limited number of our service providers. We have service providers that provide

                    technology and related infrastructure, customer service, email delivery, and auditing services. These
                    service providers may need to access Personal Data to perform their services. We authorize such service
                    providers to use or disclose the Personal Data only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply
                    with legal requirements. We require such service providers to contractually commit to protect the security
                    and confidentiality of Personal Data they process on our behalf. Our service providers are predominantly
                    located in the the United States of America.</p>
                <p>We may share your personal information with a third party if we have your consent to do so.</p>
                <h4>c. We share Personal Data as we believe necessary:</h4>
                <p>(i) to comply with applicable law, or payment method rules;</p>
                <p>(ii) to enforce our contractual rights;</p>
                <p>(iii) to protect the rights, privacy, safety and property of Cartrabbit, you or others; and</p>
                <p>(iv) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and
                    government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence.</p>
                <h3>5. Your Controls and Choices.</h3>
                <p>You have choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Data:</p>
                <h4>a. Opting out.</h4>
                <p>If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us, you may opt-out via the unsubscribe link
                    included in such emails. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.
                    Please note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you
                    important administrative messages that are required to provide you with our Services.</p>
                <h4>b. How you can see or change your account Personal Data.</h4>
                <p>If You would like to review, correct, or update Personal Data that You have previously disclosed to us, You

                <h4>c. Blocking Cookies.</h4>
                <p>You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but the Offerings may cease to
                    function properly if you do so. For more information, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
                <h4>d. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</h4>
                <p>Your Web browser may have a “do not track” setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not
                    track HTTP header file or “signal” to each site you visit. At present, the Offerings do not respond to this
                    type of signal.</p>
                <h3>6. Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</h3>
                <p>When you use the Offerings, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal
                    information upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is
                    inaccurate or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by
                    law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your
                    information at any time. To do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@cartrabbit.io" target="_blank"
                                                                               rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@cartrabbit.io</a> with your
                    name and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed, or if you are using the Service,
                    sign in to your account, go to your profile, and make the desired changes. We may decline to process
                    requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for
                    instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would
                    be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide
                    information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require
                    a disproportionate effort.</p>
                <p>Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in accordance with
                    your Customer Agreement, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your information.</p>
                <p>We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings, comply with our legal obligations or
                    resolve disputes. Note that content you post may remain on the Offerings even if you cease using the
                    Offerings or we terminate your access to the Offerings.</p>
                <h3>7. Security and Retention.</h3>
                <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical
                    and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to personal information
                    about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide
                    products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical,
                    electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information about you. When you enter
                    sensitive information (such as your password), we encrypt that information in transit using
                    industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. No method of transmission over the
                    Internet, method of electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent secure. Therefore,
                    while we strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>
                <h3>8. International Data Transfers.</h3>
                <p>We are a global business. We may from time to time transfer your personal information to other countries
                    outside the United States and make it accessible to our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and third party
                    service providers internationally. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy
                    Policy wherever it is processed.<br/>
                        Those countries may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. However,
                        we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and
                        that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h3>9. Use by Minors.</h3>
                <p>The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that they not
                    provide Personal Data through the Services.</p>
